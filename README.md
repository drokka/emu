# emu
C++ utility to represent iterative functions - somewhat sidetracked by experimenting with templates (C++11).
The plan is to have a way to easily incorporate a modifiable generator function into a fractal/image program.

Why yet another? A hobby project over the years... recently dusted off to play with Clion.
AND other fractal generaors I have found have precision determined by image pixel size. 
The plan is for the data generation to be completely independent of image properties.
